Please note that for a fully functional e-commerce website, you would need a backend server to manage products, user accounts, and payments. You'd also need a database to store product information, user data, and orders. Additionally, you would likely use a web framework like Express.js (Node.js) or Django (Python) for the backend.

This file structure is a starting point for a simple front-end representation of your e-commerce website. You can expand and customize it as needed based on the features and functionality you want to provide to your users.
